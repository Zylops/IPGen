# IPGen
I made a thing to instantly generate a valid ip address and copy it to clipboard. Because I'm a twitter user.

![Spongebob With Your IP Address](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/037/876/spongebobdoxxingyouripaddress.jpg)

## Requirements
Python 3, the pyperclip module.
I just have this in my path folder, so I can use Windows Run to launch it and get a valid ip copied rq.
